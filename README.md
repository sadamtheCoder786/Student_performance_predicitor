#  AI-Based Student Performance Predictor

Welcome to the **AI-Based Student Performance Predictor** — a smart web application designed to predict students’ academic performance using machine learning. This project is developed as part of the Spring 2025 semester for **ZAB-E-FEST** and the **Final Semester Display**.

---

## 📘 About the Project

This application uses various student-related factors such as attendance, previous grades, weekly study hours, extracurricular activities, and assignment completion rates to predict overall academic performance. The predicted result is categorized into **Excellent**, **Good**, **Average**, or **Poor**.

The goal is to help teachers and academic institutions identify students who may need early support or intervention, improving both individual outcomes and overall educational quality.

---

## 🧠 AI & Machine Learning

The intelligence of this application comes from machine learning classification techniques. The following algorithms are explored:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Decision Tree Classifier**
* **Random Forest Classifier**

The model is trained using historical academic data and integrated into a Flask web application for real-time prediction.

## 💻 Tools & Technologies

The following tools and libraries are used in this project:

* **Python** – Core language for data handling and modeling

  * `pandas` – Data manipulation
  * `scikit-learn` – Machine learning algorithms
  * `matplotlib` – Data visualization
* **Flask** – Lightweight web framework for the backend
* **HTML/CSS** – Basic frontend structure
* **Jupyter Notebook** – For training and testing models

---

## 🛠️ Project Features

* Accepts student data through a simple web form
* Predicts performance category based on trained model
* Displays results in a user-friendly interface
* Lightweight and fast to deploy

---

## 🎯 Use Case & Impact

Educational institutions often struggle to identify students at risk of poor performance until it's too late. This tool provides a proactive solution by predicting student performance in advance. It allows for:

* Early interventions (extra coaching, counseling)
* Personalized learning plans
* Improved academic results and graduation rates
